## Twitter Clone With Reugen; When making a rails app.
	added bootstrap 3 gem, and sass and improved UI.


	Known bugs : ~~"Currently the submit button only works once. and then crashes"~~
				This was caused because you can't put a form inside a table, so I removed my Table classes

				Also fixed my button errors by forcing white on all btn classses with !important


---

Established color template for buttons
-	red for delete
- light blue for edit
- orange to go Back
- green to submit a tweet or edit.
